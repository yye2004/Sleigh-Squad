## 📁 Data Storage
All book data is saved in a file of .txt format. This file stores the initial as well as the latest updated information and is loaded every time the program runs, ensuring consistency and reliability.

## 🖥️ How It Works
- When the program starts, a menu is displayed with 7 available options.
- Users enter a number between 1 to 7 to perform specific actions.
- For example:
  Enter 1 to add a new book.
  The program will guide you through inputting all necessary book details.
  If invalid input is detected, it will prompt the user to re-enter the data.
  All input prompts are case-insensitive and designed for simplicity.
